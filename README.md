# Using-MongoDB-in-Python
I have written this article for  Using MongoDB in Python.

library PyMongo is low-level implementation, while the implementation with MongoEngine can be observed as higherlevel
implementation. However, before we get into nitty-gritty details of each implementation, let’s
first install MongoDB and both Python modules.
